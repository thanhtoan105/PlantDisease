## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Plant AI Disease Detection App seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to us by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourdomain.com]
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security vulnerability reports within:

- **Initial Response**: 24-48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: 30-90 days (depending on complexity)

### Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability, we commit to:

1. **Acknowledge** your report within 24-48 hours
2. **Investigate** the issue thoroughly
3. **Keep you informed** of our progress
4. **Credit you** (if desired) in our security advisory
5. **Coordinate disclosure** timeline with you

## Security Measures

### Application Security

- **API Key Protection**: All API keys are stored securely and never exposed in client-side code
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Permission Management**: Camera and location permissions are requested appropriately
- **Secure Communication**: All API communications use HTTPS
- **Data Protection**: User data is handled according to privacy best practices

### Development Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of npm packages
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Automated Testing**: Security tests included in CI/CD pipeline
- **Environment Separation**: Development and production environments are isolated

### Data Security

- **No Personal Data Storage**: App doesn't store personal information locally
- **Image Processing**: Plant images are processed locally or securely transmitted to trusted AI services
- **Location Privacy**: Location data is only used for weather services and not stored
- **API Security**: All external API calls are secured and rate-limited

## Known Security Considerations

### Camera and Media Access
- The app requires camera access for plant image capture
- Users can revoke permissions at any time through device settings
- Images are processed locally or sent securely to AI services

### Location Services
- Location access is used solely for weather data
- Users can deny location access and manually enter location
- Location data is not stored permanently

### External APIs
- Weather data comes from trusted third-party services
- AI/ML services may process images externally
- All API communications are encrypted

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For End Users
- **Keep the app updated** to the latest version
- **Review permissions** before granting access
- **Use trusted networks** when possible
- **Report suspicious behavior** through proper channels

### For Developers
- **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
- **Follow secure coding practices**
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Review code changes** thoroughly

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure
We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Report received** and acknowledged
2. **Investigation** and verification
3. **Fix development** and testing
4. **Coordinated release** with security patch
5. **Public disclosure** after fix is available

### Public Disclosure Timeline
- **Immediate**: Critical vulnerabilities affecting user safety
- **30 days**: High-severity vulnerabilities
- **90 days**: Medium to low-severity vulnerabilities

### Recognition Program
While we don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program, we:
- **Acknowledge** security researchers in our release notes
- **Provide recognition** in our Hall of Fame (if established)
- **Consider future rewards** as the project grows

## Security Contact Information

**Primary Contact**: [security@yourdomain.com]  
**Alternative Contact**: [maintainer@yourdomain.com]  
**PGP Key**: [Link to PGP key if available]

**Response Hours**: Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM UTC  
**Emergency Contact**: For critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention

## Legal

### Safe Harbor
We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Report vulnerabilities in good faith
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and service disruption
- Provide reasonable time for vulnerability remediation
- Do not access, modify, or delete user data

### Scope
This security policy applies to:
- The main Plant AI Disease Detection App repository
- Official releases and distributions
- Associated documentation and tools

This policy does not cover:
- Third-party integrations or services
- User-generated content
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
