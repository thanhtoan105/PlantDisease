# TensorFlow Lite Model Loading Fix

## Problem

The app was showing "Model not available, providing demo results" because of a TensorFlow Lite version compatibility issue.

### Root Cause

- The TensorFlow Lite model (`apple_model_final.tflite`) was created with TensorFlow 2.16+ which uses `FULLY_CONNECTED` operation version 12
- The `tflite_flutter` package (v0.11.0) uses OLD TensorFlow Lite 2.11.0 which only supports older operation versions
- This caused the error: `Didn't find op for builtin opcode 'FULLY_CONNECTED' version '12'`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Android Build Configuration

Modified `android/build.gradle.kts` to force NEWEST TensorFlow Lite dependencies:

```kotlin
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.17.0")
        force("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu:2.17.0")
        force("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-api:2.17.0")
        force("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-support:0.4.4")
    }
}
```

### 2. Updated App Dependencies

Modified `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to explicitly include NEWEST TensorFlow Lite versions:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    val tfliteVersion = "2.17.0"  // NEWEST VERSION
    implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:$tfliteVersion")
    implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu:$tfliteVersion")
    implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-api:$tfliteVersion")
    implementation("org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-support:0.4.4")
}
```

### 3. Clean Build Process

Created `fix_tensorflow_model.ps1` script that:

- Cleans Flutter and Android build caches
- Rebuilds with new dependencies
- Verifies model file exists

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Fix Script (Recommended)

```powershell
.\fix_tensorflow_model.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

1. Clean the project:

   ```bash
   flutter clean
   ```

2. Remove Android build caches:

   ```bash
   rm -rf android/.gradle
   rm -rf android/app/build
   rm -rf android/build
   ```

3. Get dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run --debug
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:

- ✅ `TensorFlow model loaded successfully` in the logs
- ✅ `Model Loaded: ✅` in the diagnostics report
- ✅ Real AI analysis instead of demo results

## Alternative Solutions (if the above doesn't work)

### Option A: Use a Different TensorFlow Package

Replace `tflite_flutter` with `tflite_flutter_plus` in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # tflite_flutter: ^0.11.0  # Comment out
  tflite_flutter_plus: ^0.1.0 # Add this
```

### Option B: Recreate the Model

If you have access to the model training code, recreate the model with TensorFlow 2.11.0:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# Ensure you're using TensorFlow 2.11.0
print(tf.__version__)  # Should be 2.11.0

# Your model training code here
# Then convert to TFLite with older ops
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(saved_model_dir)
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS]
tflite_model = converter.convert()
```

## Files Modified

- `android/build.gradle.kts` - Added dependency resolution strategy
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Added explicit TensorFlow Lite dependencies
- `fix_tensorflow_model.ps1` - Created fix script
- `TENSORFLOW_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Technical Details

- **TensorFlow Lite 2.11.0 (OLD)**: Supports FULLY_CONNECTED up to version 11
- **TensorFlow Lite 2.17.0 (NEWEST)**: Supports FULLY_CONNECTED version 12 and higher
- **Model Requirements**: The current model requires FULLY_CONNECTED version 12
- **Solution**: Force upgrade to TensorFlow Lite 2.17.0 (newest version) in Android build
